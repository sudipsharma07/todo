The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris ) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, 
it is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species 
  to be domesticated, by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago
